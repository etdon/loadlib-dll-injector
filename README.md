## ðŸ”° Introduction

The `loadlib-dll-injector` project is a DLL injector that's utilizing the well-known LoadLibary/CreateRemoteThread method to inject DLLs into other processes.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

If want to download a pre-compiled executable you can find all releases paired with their checksums here: [Releases](https://github.com/etdon/loadlib-dll-injector/releases)

To inject a DLL into a process simply run the tool like this:
```
dll-injector.exe <Target> <DLL path>
```
The `target` parameter can either be the PID or the process name (e.g. `notepad.exe`) of the target process.

## ðŸ“¦ Building
In order to compile the source file you can use any C compiler e.g. GCC:
```
gcc dll-injector.c -o dll-injector
```
